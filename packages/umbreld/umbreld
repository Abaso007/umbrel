# We need to add this shim as the main umbreld entrypoint so we can run the start script from npm.
# This is important because npm sets up the environmnet we need like adding node_modules/.bin to the PATH
# so we have access to the local Node.js version and tsx.

# Change into the project directory
cd "$(dirname $(readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"))"

# Run the npm start script and pass through any arguments
exec npm run start --silent -- "$@"
